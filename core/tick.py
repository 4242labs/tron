"""core.tick — the bounded, crash-safe TICK HOST (contracts/blueprint-
contracts.md §5's tick model; rebuild-spec.md T1-B / B1-B11 + C1/D1's
DISPATCH front end, wave 5).

`tick(eng)` is ONE bounded pass: observe -> route -> decide -> act -> fill ->
persist -> exit.
No state carries between calls in memory — everything that must survive a
wake lives in `ctx.state` (`manifest.yaml`, via `core.state`) and is reloaded
FRESH at the top of every call (inside `core.snapshot.build`). This is
deliberate: it is what makes a crashed tick safe to just re-run
(idempotency) — the next call to `tick(eng)` reads whatever the LAST
successful `core.state.save` wrote (never this call's own in-memory
leftovers) and re-derives everything else from real git (`core.gitobs`, via
`core.gate`'s own re-derivable predicates) and the real grants dir
(`core.landing`'s content-bound, observe-first `land_via_grant`) — never
from a message this process merely remembers sending.

  observe   `core.snapshot.build(eng)` — `core.state.load` (fresh manifest)
            + drain `ctx.worker_inbox` (structured `tag`+`slots` JSON lines;
            NO LLM/classify in this brick — a `worker.done` line IS the
            local-pass report and a `worker.online` line IS the ASSIGN
            report, both read structurally) + one real trunk-tip read. See
            `core/snapshot.py`'s own docstring for the inbox's persist-gated,
            at-least-once drain discipline.

  route     `core/router.py::route` (wave 5, structured — NO LLM/classify):
            drains this tick's `worker.online` reports and ASSIGNS — opens
            the block's gate at `gate.local`, bound to the worker's OWN
            reported `worker.branch` (never a guessed `feat/<block>`). Runs
            BEFORE `decide` so a worker that came online THIS tick has its
            new gate driven THIS SAME tick, not next.

  decide    pure-ish: for each in-flight block gate in the snapshot (every
            entry in `manifest["gates"]` not already `closed`/`escalated`,
            INCLUDING any `route` just opened above), look up whatever
            local-pass report THIS tick's drain surfaced for it (or `None`)
            — no mutation yet, just the (block, gate_state, local_report)
            triples `act` will drive.

  act       idempotent: call `core.gate.advance` exactly once per in-flight
            block (one observable step each — `core.gate.advance`'s own
            contract; a full close takes many ticks, by design, the WAKE
            model). `gate.advance`'s own landing calls
            (`core.landing.land_via_grant`) are themselves idempotent by
            content-bound case-id + observe-first ancestry, so replaying
            this step against a stale-but-real manifest (a crashed tick's
            unpersisted pass) never double-lands — see
            `core/tick_rig.py`'s crash-replay proof. A gate reaching
            `closed` released its worker slot inside `gate.advance` itself
            (`eng._release_worker`); an `escalate` is just collected here
            for the tick result (a manifest field for now — sentry is a
            later wave).

  architect
  (enqueue) `core/architect.py::enqueue` (wave 9) — runs AFTER `act`,
            BEFORE `fill`: clear-ahead `forward` jobs for any in-scope row
            still missing a block file, plus a `reconcile` job (M-05) for
            the next in-scope block after each block whose outcome THIS
            tick was `record_landed`. Positioned before `fill` so a FRESH
            reconcile gate excludes its target the SAME tick it's raised —
            never a tick late (see `core/architect.py`'s own docstring for
            the mirror-image reason `advance`, below, runs AFTER `fill`).

  fill      `core/switchboard.py::fill` (wave 5) — SPAWN into whatever
            worker slots are STILL free after `act` above: a gate that
            closed THIS tick frees its slot the same tick (PULSE's own
            ordering, blueprint-contracts.md §5), so `fill` must run AFTER
            `act`, never before. State-guarded off the manifest alone
            (`core/pipeline.py`'s own in-flight read) — a block already
            in-flight (a live worker awaiting ASSIGN, or an open gate) is
            never re-picked, so a block is dispatched exactly once, whether
            across ticks or within this same call. Wave 8: `fill` is handed
            a FILTERED view (`casestate.dispatch_excluded_blocks` dropped —
            every block with a still-OPEN parked case or an abandoned flag —
            UNIONED, wave 9, with `architect.gated_blocks` — every block
            with an outstanding reconcile job) rather than the raw
            `pipeline.read_view` result — a walled block's doc status on
            trunk is untouched (TRON never writes project git outside
            `land.sh`), so once its gate frees the slot (`core/casestate.py
            ::open_case`) it would otherwise read as genuinely dispatchable
            again before the operator ever settles it; `core/session.py::
            check` below still reads the UNFILTERED view (an open case, or
            a reconcile-gated block, must still count as "pending", never
            silently drop out of scope).

  architect
  (advance) `core/architect.py::advance` (wave 9) — runs AFTER `fill`:
            progresses whatever job the architect currently holds by
            exactly one step, and is the ONE place a completed `reconcile`
            job's `current_job` is cleared (freeing the block for dispatch
            starting the NEXT tick, never this same one — the STRICT
            `spawn_tick > reconciled_tick` ordering `core/architect_rig.py`
            proves). Then, if idle, pops + starts the next queued job.

  persist   `core.state.save` — atomic, and ONLY after the whole pass above
            has run to completion. Then, and only then, the drained inbox
            sidecar is released (`core.snapshot.release`). If this process
            dies anywhere before this line, NOTHING durable has changed: the
            next `tick(eng)` call reloads the exact prior manifest and (if a
            `.proc` sidecar survived) re-drains the same report — safe,
            because every mutation `act`/`route`/`fill` performed is either
            re-derivable from real git/grants state or itself a plain,
            re-derivable-on-replay manifest write, never trusted from memory
            alone.

Keeps ALL git observation inside `core.gitobs` (via `core.gate`/
`core.snapshot`/`core.pipeline`); this module itself makes no file-IO or
git/subprocess call of any kind — it only orchestrates `core.snapshot` +
`core.router` + `core.gate` + `core.switchboard` + `core.state`.

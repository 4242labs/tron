"""core.session — the clean SESSION-END terminal (wave 6; contracts/
blueprint-contracts.md §1's SWITCHBOARD "wait or session:end", rebuild-spec.md
C2/H4's run-end/ANCHOR/teardown). Signal WHICH the terminal fires on is
learned by READING `engine/fsm.py::_all_settled` / `_end_session` (re-
expressed fresh here for the new `core/` stack's manifest shape — never
copied, never its parked-case/architect-queue/cadence machinery, which stay
out of scope for this brick): a run is settled when every IN-SCOPE roadmap
row is done and nothing is in flight. `OPEN_STATUSES` there is exactly
`IN_SCOPE_STATUSES` here (`"to-do"`, `"in-progress"`) — a block whose trunk
status is `deferred`/`debt`/`cut`/`folded`/`split` is deliberately OUT of the
"must reach done" scope (the same rows `fsm.py`'s own `OPEN_STATUSES` gate
excludes) and never blocks a clean end.

`check(manifest, view) -> dict | None` is a PURE read over a manifest +
`core.pipeline.read_view` result already fetched by the caller this tick
(`core/tick.py`, threaded through the SAME view `core/switchboard.py::fill`
used — never a second trunk read of this module's own; no git/subprocess of
any kind lives here):

  - Returns `None` when the run is not yet settled — legitimate, no error:
    any in-scope block still in-flight (`core.pipeline.in_flight_blocks`) or
    genuinely pending (to-do and dispatchable, or to-do/in-progress waiting
    on an unmet dep that is ITSELF still in-scope and not yet done) is an
    ordinary "not done yet", not a gap.
  - Wave 8 (`core/casestate.py`): a block the operator explicitly ABANDONED
    (`manifest["abandoned_blocks"]`, written by `casestate.settle`'s
    `abandon` verb) is skipped OUTRIGHT — same treatment as a `deferred`/
    `cut`/`folded`/`split` row below, never re-derived from its doc status.
    "Abandon means drop — visibly": the block's own trunk status is left
    exactly as `worker.wall` found it (never `done`, TRON never writes
    project git for this), so without this exclusion it would fall straight
    into the `stuck` gap below the instant its gate frees the slot — a
    dropped block must never block, and must never falsely RAISE on, a
    clean end.
  - Returns `{"ended_at": <iso8601 utc>, "reason": <str>}` — a fresh clean-
    terminal marker — only when EVERY in-scope block is `done` on trunk AND
    nothing is in-flight. The CALLER (`core/tick.py`) is the one that writes
    this into `manifest["session"]` and persists it (this module never
    mutates a manifest itself, exactly like `core/pipeline.py::dispatchable`
    never does) — `manifest["session"]["ended_at"]` is the SAME field name/
    shape `engine/fsm.py::_end_session` already uses (`sess["ended_at"] =
    util.now_iso()`), re-expressed for this stack, not forked.
  - Raises `RuntimeError` — FAIL-LOUD, never a silent "end" — when a block is
    stuck neither done, in-flight, nor dispatchable, and not legitimately
    waiting on a still-pending in-scope dependency: e.g. an `in-progress`
    block with no matching manifest state at all (orphaned), a `to-do` block
    `core.pipeline.dispatchable` would already have picked up (a real
    contradiction), or a `to-do` block permanently blocked by a dependency
    that will NEVER reach `done` (a `deferred`/`cut`/`folded`/`split` dep, or
    a `Depends on` id absent from the pipeline entirely — a typo). This
    mirrors `core/gitobs.py::read_pipeline_view`'s own "fail-loud, never a
    guess" discipline (raises uncaught, propagated by `core/tick.py`) rather
    than silently declaring the run over on a state nothing can explain.

`already_ended(manifest) -> bool` is the idempotent-terminal predicate
`core/tick.py` checks BEFORE doing any observe/route/act/fill work at all —
a genuine no-op re-tick (no git read, no manifest mutation) once
`manifest["session"]["ended_at"]` is on file.
